## UX

The UX design aims were to provide a easy to read site that uses colors and fonts that look good on multiple devices, screen sizes, browsers
and operating systems will trying to keep the site quick to load and navigate.

### Project Purpose

The goal of my portfolio site is to showcase my skills and experience in a simple & effective way using the following:

- Easy navigation and familiar layout across the pages.
- Making the project accessible.
- Giving the visitor information on ym skills.
- Providing clients and employers a list contact information.
- Viewing my projects page to get a taste of my potential.
- Providing a link to my CV.
- A attractive layout and styling.
- Adding some interactivity

### User Experience

- Simple layout to allow easy navigation.
- Cross platform layouts to accomodate different device screens sizes.
- Quick load times.
- Familiar layout across the pages including fonts, colors and proportions with the help of grid.

### User Stories

- To give users a background of the web developer.
- To provide users with a easy to navigate website that is hosted on the internet.
- To allow employers to gain a understanding of some of the skills of the developer and access to his CV.
- To be able to share the contact info with the user easily.

### Design Ideas

The design of the website based on trying to give a simple but straight forward layout without over complication or a sense of too much going on.
The goal of this simple portfolio site is to establish a basic portfolio page that can be improved and added to over it's life cycle.
The design is meant to be mobile and desktop friendly.
I wanted to use what I learnt about the grid for my layout instead of using a framework like bootstrap.cdn to make a structured layout.

#### Fonts

    Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif.

#### Colors

    Midnightblue, orangered, oldlace, gray, blue.

#### Styling
    I styled my pages using CSS3, fontawesome's CDN for icons, and images from my PC and the Web.
    I applied my CSS3 styles from a seperate file in the assets folder to speed up load times and keep the code more maintainable.

### Wireframes

- I made my wireframes by hand with pencil and square ruled paper.

- #### Wireframes

- Mobile views:
![Alt text](Assets\wireFrames\indexMobileView.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](Assets\wireFrames\contactMobileView.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](Assets\wireFrames\skillsMobileView.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](Assets\wireFrames\portfolioMobileView.png?raw=true "Title")
- Desktop & Tablet views:

![Alt text](Assets\wireFrames\contactPageDesktop&Tablet.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](Assets\wireFrames\skillsPageDesktop&Tablet.png?raw=true "Title")

### Developer and Business Purpose

- Must show clear & professional examples of HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Python.


## Features

My site features consistent layout on a given device including, header section, navigation bar that responds to users if they hover over it, main element that has sections usingthe grid for better layout.
- Images and icons
- Clickable links
- A interactive link for CV to help encourage a user to view it.
- 4 pages covering different topics about the developer.

### Existing Features

The current features are basic and not complicated as meantioned above.
They provide a base upon which to elaborate and make the site more interactive.

#### Navbar

The navbar consists of 4 buttons that are on one row on larger screens but will stack on top of eachother and span the width of the screen on smaller devices.
The buttons change color when the user mouses over them from gray to blue to provide some interaction and response so the user knows that they have the option to interact with the buttons. 
The fonts and colors are easy to read.
The buttons navigate on each page and allow easy navigation without the need of hitting the back button in the browser.

**Tablet & Desktop**
The desktop and tablet views do not stack columns and rows and use 4 columns with up to 6 rows or sections not including the header, navbar and footer.

**Mobile**
The mobile view stacks images, icons, nav buttons and other content better for smaller screens. It typically tries to use 1 column and 1 row.
It has the ability to overflow automatically.

#### Footer

- Displays the website creator and year the site was produced.
- Contributes to structured layout by using HTML5 element footer istead of a div.

#### Home Page

- This is called the landing page and is known as the index.html page in this project.
- It provides visitors a bit of information about the creator through text and images.

#### Contact Page

- This page provides user with ways of contacting teh creator for business purposes or job related enquirys.
- This page is know as the contact.html page and shares email, phone, linkedin and github information.

#### Skills Page

- This page has the purpose of sharing the skillset and other skills the developer has covered and qualifications achieved.

#### Projects Page

- This page has red links that are clickable that will take the user to the websites created by the developer.
- The list does not show all work but is intended as a sample of some of the potential of this junior developer.

## Project planning:

I planned out the project by first making a list of steps needed in order to create the finished product.

- Planning and collecting assets
- Wireframes
- Making a readme and setting up the development IDE and git version control.
- Structure
- Styling
- Making the site responsive.
- Making the site interactive.
- Deployment options.
- Room for improvement.

### Defensive design

- I added alt attributes to images incase they failed to load.
- I used seperate files for html, styles and javascript for easier coding and maintenance.
- I chose github version control to prevent loss of progress and the ability to roll back to previous versions if needed.
- I tried to check that the pages good across various screen sizes.

## Testing

I tested my code with google chrome developer tools to help speed up development and test out changes on a copy of the source code.

## Known Issues to be fixed

I know that there is currently room for improvement and I intend to develop this site further, improve the styles and layout, add extra content and projects as well as make it more interactive as my experience grows.

## Deployment

I used git hub version control to save content to a remote repository on github and then deploy the live site using github's github pages functionality.


## Technologies Used

### Tools

- Visual studio code
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used as a remote backup of code used in the project & used to showcase code remotely.


### Libraries

- [FontAwesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/) to apply informative icons used throughout the website.
